# network-modeling-GNN

This repository includes a collection of Graph Neural Network (GNN) models applied to computer network modeling.

**1. Towards more realistic network models based on Graph Neural Networks**

This work extends RouteNet to include support for modeling end-to-end performance in networks with forwarding nodes of variable qeue size.
